# Pong

![]()

After taking a finance-oriented Python course in college, I wanted to learn more about Python and try to do something fun with it. Having recently picked up pickle ball, programming Pong seemed like a fun idea! :)

This was my first time using Pygames or Object Oriented Program (such as the Ball class). I followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVGTZlnnX3U) by _Tech With Tim_ on YouTube and would highly recommend him for someone looking for a similar project!

In the future, I plan to add to this following his video which adds AI to the Pong game linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f6TmKm7yx0)
